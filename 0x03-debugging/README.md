0x03. C - Debugging
0. Multiple mains
Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function 'positive or negative()' gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
1. Like, comment, subscribe
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2. 0 > 972?
Fix the code in '2-largest number.c' so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
Line count will not be checked for this task.

3. Leap year
This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. 
That doesn’t seem right.
Fix the print remaining days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
